Jump Chile: Marketplace: Tokenized venture capital assets (2019)

**Pitch:** https://youtu.be/_oshvfDnEXo

**Description:**
<br>

Venture Capital is one of the major contributors to the development of technological innovation. It has invested in 43% of the companies currently listed on the stock exchanges in the United States. Furthermore, it is an attractive investment category, as it generates returns well above the average.

That being said, there are several constraints within the industry. The major obstacles include low liquidity, as it takes a considerable amount of time to generate profits (an average venture capital fund locks in investments for a period of 10-12 years). In addition, there are high barriers to entry (the minimum entry amount starts at $500,000), and there are high risks associated with this type of investment. These obstacles discourage a significant number of potential investors, both professional investors and financial institutions.

The new era of digital assets offers unique opportunities to provide profitable liquidity solutions. In this context, Afiste is a Fintech that offers a digital platform aiming to comply with both asset issuance and market regulations. The goal is to foster an ecosystem where venture capital funds can increase their capital, tokenize their investment portfolios, and sell them as digital assets. By doing so, a new tool will be created to increase liquidity in the Venture Capital market and investment volume.


**Project Background:**
<br>

This project was developed during my second semester of Business Administration while simultaneously participating in Jump Chile, a business idea acceleration program focused on higher education students in Chile and Latin America. The program is organized by the Catholic University of Chile through the UC Innovation Center.

We were selected among the top 20 out of more than 800 Latin American projects.
