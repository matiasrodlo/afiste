Jump Chile: Marketplace: Tokenized venture capital assets (2019)

**Pitch:** https://youtu.be/_oshvfDnEXo

Venture Capital is one of the major contributors to the development of technological innovation. It has invested in 43% of the companies currently listed on the stock exchanges in the United States. Furthermore, it is an attractive investment category, as it generates returns well above the average.

That being said, there are several constraints within the industry. The major obstacles include low liquidity, as it takes a considerable amount of time to generate profits (an average venture capital fund locks in investments for a period of 10-12 years). In addition, there are high barriers to entry (the minimum entry amount starts at $500,000), and there are high risks associated with this type of investment. These obstacles discourage a significant number of potential investors, both professional investors and financial institutions.

The new era of digital assets offers unique opportunities to provide profitable liquidity solutions. In this context, Afiste is a Fintech that offers a digital platform aiming to comply with both asset issuance and market regulations. The goal is to foster an ecosystem where venture capital funds can increase their capital, tokenize their investment portfolios, and sell them as digital assets. By doing so, a new tool will be created to increase liquidity in the Venture Capital market and investment volume.

Therefore, Afiste aims to:

Provide a solution by implementing a portfolio tokenization process, converting traditional assets into digital format.
Enable holders to offer these digital assets to other investors through initial offerings on the platform.
List these digital assets on Afiste's marketplace and ensure transactions in a secondary market.
Monitor compliance and execution of payment flows.
Create an end-to-end ecosystem that allows both retail and professional or institutional investors to access venture capital through the creation of a new class of digital and tradable financial assets.
By making these instruments more liquid, the goal is to increase the amount of capital available in the funds market for startups and SMEs. In this way, efforts to drive innovation and transform the productive base of economies in Latin America will be empowered.

Since its inception, Afiste has prioritized collaborative work based on co-creation, engagement with regulators, and the construction of an ecosystem for its commercial launch. Additionally, the company has developed a framework for issuing and listing assets and has formed strategic alliances with key players in its value chain.
