We are pleased to present Peatio Open Source 2.6.0.

This release concentrated on changes for user deposit addresses generation, new wallet clients, platform reliability, and security updates:

    1. Unify deposit addresses for ETH & ERC20 tokens.
    2. Global Withdraw Limits.
    3. Implement adaptive gas_price setting.
    4. Opendax wallet client support.
    5. Yaml based admin and user permissions.
    6. PostgreSQL and MariaDB support.

This release note is a must-read for migrating from older versions.

### Breaking changes ###

- Global Withdraw Limits [\#2670](https://github.com/openware/peatio/pull/2670) ([mnaichuk](https://github.com/mnaichuk))

  Introduce the admin's ability to set global withdrawal limits in one currency (the platform global currency) for users.
  Application of specific limits, depending on user KYC level and group.
  Time limits control for one day or one month period.

  * Add admin and public API modules for withdrawal limits.
  * Add user endpoint for withdrawal sums for each period.

- Feature: Implement adaptive gas\_price setting [\#2684](https://github.com/openware/peatio/pull/2684) ([mnaichuk](https://github.com/mnaichuk))

  Add the option "gas_price" to a currency with those possible values: `standard`, `safelow`, `fast`. By default, peatio will use the `standard` option. Make sure to change eth base currencies to those possible values.

- Feature: Unify deposit addresses for ETH & ERC20 tokens [\#2575](https://github.com/openware/peatio/pull/2575) ([mnaichuk](https://github.com/mnaichuk))

  Now a user will get a single deposit address for ETH and ERC20 tokens. One deposit wallet will be able to have a few currencies.
  Make sure to run related migration and configure Wallet <> Currency relations after.

  * Add Wallet <> Currency association
  * PaymentAddress now belongs to Member and a platform Wallet
  * Admin endpoints to add and delete a currency to a wallet

- Encrypt Beneficiary data [\#2702](https://github.com/openware/peatio/pull/2702) ([mnaichuk](https://github.com/mnaichuk))

  Encrypt Beneficiary `data` field using vault transit. The migration will automatically insert data for existing beneficiaries.

- Feature: Add user permissions [\#2730](https://github.com/openware/peatio/pull/2730) ([chumaknadya](https://github.com/chumaknadya))
  
  Introduce permissions for users with `cancan` based on the YAML file. Config [example](https://github.com/openware/peatio/blob/master/config/abilities.yml)

- Feature: Introduce yaml based admin permissions in peatio [\#2643](https://github.com/openware/peatio/pull/2643) ([chumaknadya](https://github.com/chumaknadya))
